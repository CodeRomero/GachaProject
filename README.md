# Project: Gacha

## Project Description
This project uses a microservices approach that creates a whimsical web gacha game. "Gacha games" are any game system that induces users to spend in-game currency to open loot boxes for a chance at obtaining some entity that is used in gameplay. Typically, the in-game currency is bought with real world currency, but this project utilizes digital collectibles from the Pokemon franchise, therefore users gain in-game currency through minigames instead of real currency. This Gacha provides a variety of social and gameplay features to keep users engaged. Project features are implemented by consuming a 3rd party Pokemon API and a custom-made Gacha API and combining it with an Angular front end, then containerized and deployed via Azure Kubernetes.

These collectibles can be viewed and sorted as a collection by a user or even traded between users. Users can make comments related to PokeLoot and view or respond to other usersâ€™ comments.  Each user also has a profile that can be viewed by other users.  Users can also see a menagerie of statistics related to PokeLoot collections that can be used to generally infer who has been the most successful completing their collection.
